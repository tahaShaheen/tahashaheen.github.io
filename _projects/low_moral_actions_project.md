This research was conducted during my master’s studies at the <a href="https://www.robot.soc.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/">Human-Robot Interaction Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en">Kyoto University</a>. You can read the manuscript titled Investigation of Low-Moral Actions by Malicious Anonymous Operators of Avatar Robots <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3696466">here</a>.

Imagine a world where people use robots to visit different places and countries. Unlike screens on wheels (telepresence robots), avatar robots can look like anything. One flaw of this is that it is not readily apparent to bystanders who the operator of the robot is. Malicious operators can use this anonymity to do low-moral actions, which we define as not only illegal acts but also acts that violate norms of society.

In {% cite shaheen2024lowmoralactions %}, we looked at what low-moral actions were possible and what prevention mechanisms were applicable for each. We identified four categories and 15 subcategories of malicious acts that can be done when a robot is limited to locomotor movement and video feed from the robot’s eyes to the operator only. Before the workshops, participants experienced avatar robots by controlling both a simulated avatar and a real avatar as a malicious anonymous operator in a variety of situations. They also experienced sharing space with an avatar controlled by a malicious anonymous operator.

We conducted three hazard identification workshops with a total of 12 participants (6 male, 6 female) to brainstorm possible low-moral actions. Participants first experienced avatar robots by operating a real robot, a simulated avatar, and sharing space with an avatar robot. Activities included tasks like navigating through simulated environments such as shopping malls and convenience stores, where participants acted as malicious operators. This experience phase was critical for ideation, ensuring that participants understood the technology and its potential for misuse.

Through these workshops, we identified four main categories of low-moral actions:
<ol>
    <li>Violate Privacy and Security: Actions such as eavesdropping or entering forbidden spaces.</li>
    <li>Inhibit: Blocking access to resources or obstructing movement.</li>
    <li>Annoy: Actions like unnatural movement or invading personal space.</li>
    <li>Destroy or Hurt: Causing physical harm to individuals or damage to property.</li>
</ol>

Each category was further divided into subcategories, resulting in a comprehensive list of potential actions and their manifestations. For instance, "Inhibit Movement" included examples like blocking hallways, while "Annoy" covered actions such as chasing individuals or misleading them.
